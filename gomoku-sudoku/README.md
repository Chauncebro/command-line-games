This project contains the game Gomoku playable with custom board dimmension
and sodoku playable with custom starting position.  Note you will have to 
provide your own beggining position for sodoku.  Additionally, this has
functioning tictactoe.  To select game, supply a command line argument with
the game you wish to play, and for gomoku add in the dimmension and winning 
amount, if you wish to deviate from the standard.

These games also have the ability to save the current position when exiting
from the game mid match.  To add a sodoku starting position, place a file
called "sodoku.txt" in the build folder of the program and format the 
file with numbers and dashes '-' seperated by line with no extra whitespace
